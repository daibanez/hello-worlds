# Hello Worlds

Non-trivial HelloWorld project setups.

Each implementation will implement a HelloWorld console application that follows tech stack based conventions to:

- Take in optial args to output "Hello {arg[i]}!".
- Setup project structure.
- Includes unit tests.
- Use a task runner to build, test, clean, etc.
- Utilize a dependency management system where appropriate.
- Implement code quality checking with a linter (integrated with task runner).



Implementations:

+ C# w/ .NET Core
  + C# is a major target for industry and with .NET Core it can now be cross-platform.
+ Java w/ Gradle
  + Java, the original JVM language. A case can be made for Scala or Kotlin, but the features that other JVM languages add are typically pulled into Java in future versions anyway.
+ C++ w/ make
  + Just the language I learned with in college.
+ Python
  + Seems to always be in the middle of the language popularity list.
+ TypeScript w/ Node.js and NPM
  + Pure Javascript would just be tedious.
+ Haskell w/ Cabal
  + Just to make me think differently.

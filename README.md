# Hello Worlds

Non-trivial HelloWorld project setups for a few languages with reason:

+ C# w/ .NET Core
  + C# is a major target for industry and with .NET Core it can now be cross-platform.
+ Java w/ Gradle
  + Java, the original JVM language. A case can be made for Scala or Kotlin, but the features that other JVM languages add are typically pulled into Java in future versions anyway.
+ C++
  + Just the language I learned with in college.
+ Python
  + Seems to always be in the middle of the language popularity list.
+ TypeScript w/ Node.js and NPM
  + Pure Javascript would just be tedious.
+ Haskell w/ Cabal
  + Just to make me think differently.
